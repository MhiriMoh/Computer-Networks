In order to implement pseudo-concurrency for our application, we utilized the functionality of the select 
function inside of an infinite loop which only exits when the server is shut down or an error occurs. Rather 
than using threads to implement parallel concurrency (which is more efficientas multiple threads are 
running at the same time) we use select as it is simpler to implement and understand. Thread implementation
requires the use of OS system calls that otherwise aren't required to be implemented if one uses select.
