	We discovered that sim1 had a bit rate of 1000 bps and a propagation delay of 624166 microseconds. Sim2's bit rate was also 1000 bps and the propagation delay is almost 4 times larger than sim1's. Sim3 had a bit rate of 100 bps, but Sim3's tprop is twice as large as Sim1's.

	An explanation as to how Sim2's tprop is larger than Sim1's is that Sim2 must be simulating a server that is "further away" than Sim1, this would explain the larger tprop.

	Sim2 has a larger bit rate than Sim3, and Sim3's tprop is roughly half as long.
