PART 1

1. What is the IP address of the host?
	192.168.0.107

2. What is the IP address of the router?
	192.168.0.1

3. What protocol is used to resolve the website domain name?
	DNS (Domain Name System)

4. What is the IP address of the HTTP server?
	128.100.72.45

5. Which transport layer protocol is used by DNS?
	UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

6. Which well-known port is used when contacting the DNS server?
	53

7. Which ephemeral port does the host initiating the DNS query use?
	54883

8. What is the Ethernet address of the host?
	d8:30:62:62:70:5f

9. What is the Ethernet address of the router?
	00:13:46:a7:d3:02

10. How long does the 3-way handshake take to complete?
	0.025248 - 0.014746 = 0.010502 sec

11. Which website is the host machine trying to access?
	www.utoronto.ca

12. What version of HTTP is the browser running?
	HTTP/1.1

13. In the filter box enter the following query: udp.dstport==53 ​and click apply. What does the
query mean and what are the results?
	Filters all the DNS queries going to / sent to port 53 as its destination

14. Go to Statistics -> Protocol Hierarchy and answer:
	A. What percentage of frames are Ethernet frames?
		100%

	B. Which transport layer protocols were present and which one made up more of the traffic?
		TCP = 96.7%, UDP = 3.3%, TCP makes more

15. Now plot the UDP and TCP traffic as follows:
	A. What is the highest number of TCP packets/sec observed? Around what time (second)?
		1330 packets/sec @ 1 second

	B. What is the highest number of UDP packets/sec observed? Around what time (second)?
		73 packets/sec @ 5 sec

	C. What is the highest number of HTTP bits/sec observed? Around what time (second)?
		223152 bits/sec @ 1 sec

PART 2

1. What is the protocol in packet #50 and what is it used for?
	SIP/SDP (Session Initiation Protocol), comunication protocol for controlling multimedia communication systems (e.g. internet telephony)

2. What is the protocol in packet #55 and what is it used for?
	RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol), for delivering audio and video over IP networks (VOIP)

3. Examine the details of packet #55 and study the “payload type”. What is likely in this
payload?
	Payload Type: ITU-T G.711 PCMU (0), PCM = Pulse Code Modulation, audio companding/ information packet

4. How much time elapses from packet #55 to packet #1329? How much Bytes has been used
during this period? Hint: Use IO Graph to answers these questions
	Time: 178.954983 - 166.095301 = 12.859 sec (Calculated using timestamps)
	Bytes: 21600(Bytes/sec) * 14 sec = 302400 (estimation made using I/O Graph)

5. What is going on in this capture?
	Given that the packets are mainly audio packets and that RTP is used throughout, this must be a conversation i.e. VOIP
