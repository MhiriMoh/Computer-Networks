1. Briefly describe how ping uses ICMP to find out about IP hosts and the
information that it collects.
	Ping uses ICMP in order to get the round trip response time. It does this by making use of ICMP echo request and waits for a reply that send back information pertaining to the reply (eror, time, ip address)

2. Briefly describe how traceroute uses UDP and ICMP together to determine a
route to a specified host.
	UDP makes a request to an invalid port number to the destination. Th packet travels along the routers with the TTL set to 1 which indicates expiration after 1 hop. once this packet encounters its first router, the ttl is decremented and an ICMP Time Exceeded/Time to Live Exceeded in Transit message is sent back and the TTL is incremented to 2 (meaning 2 routers until expiration). This is repeated until the packet reaches the destination and the destination reads the invalid port number and sends an ICMP Destination Unreachable/Port Unreachable message which signals the end of the traceroute


3. Use ping to find values for minimum, average and maximum round trip time to
www.utoronto.ca. Compare this to the min/avg/max round trip time to
www.163.com (free e-mail service in China). What causes the difference in
round trip time to the two servers?
	www.utoronto.ca --> min = 7.733ms avg = 8.235ms max = 9.826ms
	www.163.com --> min = 29.951ms avg = 31.111ms max = 35.121ms
	need to do more hops for 163.com and therefore longer time for complete response

4. The distance from Toronto to China is approximately 10,000 km. If light
travels at 3x10^8 m/s what is the approximate minimum round trip time from
your machine to www.163.com? Compare this to the average round trip time
found in question 1. Explain your findings.
	2*33.33ms = 67ms is the minimum roundtrip time from our machine to China at the speed of light, therefore the china server must be much closer than the distance in this question


5. Estimate the round trip ping time to www.bbc.co.uk (British News site)?
	The distance between Toronto and Britain is 5345 km and the speed of light travels this in 2*17.8 = 35.6ms


6. Find the actual round trip ping time to www.bbc.co.uk and compare it to your
estimate. Explain your findings.
	Avg time is 83.273ms which is much higher than the minimum possible time, this makes sense because there is overhead for every network node and the method of sending differs from node to node 


7. Find the option in ping which lets you change the packet size. Now ping a
machine with 10 byte packets and repeat for 10,000 byte packets and
compare the round trip times.
	a 10 byte packet size does not report a timing report, but a 16 byte one does, the payload is large enough that a time stamp is warranted, the round trip time elapsed increases with the size of the packet (can be seen by the relationship between 16 bytes and 10000 bytes) (size matters)


8. What is the default packet size for ping?
	56 Bytes


9. Issue the following command to find the server hosting the Harvard website:
nslookup www.harvard.com
● The first part of the response informs you which DNS server handled your
request
● The second part informs you of the IP address corresponding to the
domain you queried
● What is the IP address of the DNS server you queried and what is the IP
address of the server hosting www.harvard.com?​
	DNS IP - 128.100.13.50
	IP Address of harvard - 64.64.9.47


10. Use the traceroute command to find the # of hops to the DNS server and web
server you found in question #2. What is the reason for the difference in
number of hops? Is the DNS server likely a Local Name Server or a Root Name
Server?
	- 1 hop for the DNS server
	- 30 hops for the web server
	- DNS server is likely a Local Name Server


11. Use the command: netstat --tcp ​to find the number of active TCP
connections on your machine.
	There are 16 active TCP connections on this machine


12. Open a browser and connect to www.cnn.com. Now issue the same
command as in question 11 and find the TCP entry corresponding to your new
http session. Explain your findings.
	There are now 30 active TCP connections, the new connections are the ones required to access cnn.com


13. Use the command: netstat --statistics ​to answer the following
questions:
	a) How many ICMP echo requests did your machine receive?
		1 echo requests
	
	b) How many ICMP echo replies did your machine send?
		1 echo replies
	
	c) How many UDP packets to unknown ports did your machine receive?
		144 packets to unknown ports


14. Use the command: ip addr to find the Ethernet address and IP address of
your machine. What are the addresses?
	IP address: 128.100.13.52
	Ethernet address: 08:62:66:44:96:1a


15. Perform an nslookup on the IP address of your machine to determine the
hostname of your machine. What is the hostname?
	hostname: ug52.eecg.toronto.edu.


16. Use the command: ip route show to inspect the local routing table. There
should be two entries. Explain what each of the entries means.
	- The default route to networks outside of the 128.100.13.0/24 network go through 128.100.13.254
